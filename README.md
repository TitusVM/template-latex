# Template-LaTeX

LaTeX template for MSE semester and thesis reports.

## Getting Started

This template provides a LaTeX class which simply replaces and extends the standard directive `report`.

*It is recommended that you configure your workspace as shown below, then it will be easy to keep it updated.*

Create a new folder for your report, then run git clone command.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:njakob/template-latex.git
```

Then copy an example from `/examples` folder into your workspace.
```shell
$ cp -a template-latex/examples/simple-report/* ./
```

Now you can start to write your report in `thesis.tex`.
